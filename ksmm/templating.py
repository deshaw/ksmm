"""Provides templating of the kernelspec.

That is to say write a kernelspec with placeholder for values, as well as describe
which values this placeholder can take (using JSON schema  in the future).

And allow to update the kernelspec by replacing the placeholders by given values.

Utilities (should) be provided to extract only what are the placeholder and which values they can take,
as well as taking an existing kernelspec and modifying those values.

    dependencies, for example, a user might select "100GB" and convert
    that to Kb, or various values that depends on the software we use.

    Parameters
    ----------

    item: list | str
        item to format
    mapping:
        lookup for element not in kwargs
    **kwargs:
        values to interpolate

    Examples
    --------

    >>> recursive_format(['{mem} {cpu} {left_alone}','--mem={mem_slurm}'],
    ...         {
    ...             'mem_slurm':{

    Notes
    -----

    This is sort of a poor man templating engine, but we can't really use syntax like jinja
    {cpu|to_kb}, as we are not sure those templates will be used in Python context.
    And we are also not sure how to ship those function unless they become part of the spec.
    With this approach kernelspec embed their own things.
